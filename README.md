# An Om/React client of the game of life

Based on cgrand's [solution] (https://github.com/clojurebook/ClojureProgramming/tree/master/ch03-game-of-life) in the book Clojure Programming

The visualisation is inspired by the excellent presentation of React.js by [steveluscher at react-supervanjs-2013] (https://github.com/steveluscher/react-supervanjs-2013)

The purpose is to help people discover and understand Om/React during a dojo at the Paris Clojure Meetup.
